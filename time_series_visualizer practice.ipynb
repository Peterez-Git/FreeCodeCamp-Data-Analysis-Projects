    "For this project you will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. You will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help you understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.\n",

    "<li>Clean the data by filtering out days when the page views were in the top 2.5% of the dataset or bottom 2.5% of the dataset.</li><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Create a draw_line_plot function that uses Matplotlib to draw a line chart similar to \"examples/Figure_1.png\". The title should be Daily freeCodeCamp Forum Page Views 5/2016-12/2019. The label on the x axis should be Date and the label on the y axis should be Page Views.</li><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Create a draw_bar_plot function that draws a bar chart similar to \"examples/Figure_2.png\". It should show average daily page views for each month grouped by year. The legend should show month labels and have a title of Months. On the chart, the label on the x axis should be Years and the label on the y axis should be Average Page Views.</li><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Create a draw_box_plot function that uses Seaborn to draw two adjacent box plots similar to \"examples/Figure_3.png\".</li><br> \n",
    "\n",
    "<li>These box plots should show how the values are distributed within a given year or month and how it compares over time.</li><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>The title of the first chart should be Year-wise Box Plot (Trend) and the title of the second chart should be Month-wise Box Plot (Seasonality).</li><br>\n",

    "<li>Make sure the month labels on bottom start at Jan and the x and y axis are labeled correctly. The boilerplate includes commands to prepare the data.</li><br>\n",
